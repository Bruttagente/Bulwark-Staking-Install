# Bulwark-Staking-Install
Simple script to get staking on a VPS without a masternode!

To get started, run the below script:

```
bash <( curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KaneoHunter/Bulwark-Staking-Install/master/setup.sh )
```

It's recommended to write all outputs given to you down, and store them somewhere safe asap. Once stored in a safe place please enter the below command:

```
rm -Rf ~/.bulwark/StakingInfoReadMe.txt
```

This deletes the document containing your passwords and import keys, making sure your VPS is as safe as possible.
